#' Two-mode network of Southern women attending events.
#'
#' These data were collected by Davis, Gardner and Gardner in the 1930s. They represent attendance at 14 social events by 18 Southern women. The result is a person-by-event matrix, with people in the rows and events in the columns. A cell (i,j) is 1 if person i attended social event j, and 0 otherwise. (See also Chapter 13 of Borgatti et al., 2022).
