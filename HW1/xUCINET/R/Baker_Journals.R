#' Citation network among social work journals collected by Baker.
#'
#' Donald Baker collected data on the citations among 20 social work journals for 1985-1986. The data consist of the number of citations from articles in one journal to articles in another journal. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, he found that the network seems to have a core-periphery structure, and argues that American journals tend to be less likely to involve international literature.
